Dear Mr. White,
    We are so pleased to hear of the safe arrival of your baby.  He must be lovely baby boy. Congratulations on becoming a young father.
    We pray that the baby will grow up to be a good citizen of the country and bring honor and glory to the family and motherland.
    Please enjoy every moment spent with the baby. We hope your wife will make satisfactory progress after labor.

Affectionately yours,
Mr. and Mrs. Black

亲爱的怀特先生：

听到你孩子平安出生的消息，我们真的很高兴。他一定是个很讨人喜欢的小男生。恭喜你成为年轻的爸爸。

我们祈祷孩子茁壮成长，将来成为国家的好公民，为家庭和祖国带来荣誉。

好好享受跟孩子在一起的每一刻吧！我们希望你的妻子产后早日恢复。

您亲爱的，
布莱克夫妇

1. We pray that...我们祈祷……
    EX: We pray that your wife will make satisfactory progress after labor.
    我们祈祷你的妻子产后早日恢复。
2. Please + 祈使句 请……
    EX: Please give my best wishes to your wife and your lovely baby.
    请代我向你的妻子和孩子表示祝福。

如果这样写也可以！
1. 祝福您的小宝宝幸福平安。
    All the best to your little baby.
2. 听说您得了个宝贝女儿真是太好了！
    How wonderful to hear that you had a baby girl!
3. 请照顾好你的妻子和宝宝。
    Please take care of your wife and your baby.
4. 我相信您会成为一个好父亲。
    I am sure that you will be a good father.
5. 请接受我们热烈的祝贺，祝贺您成为年轻的父亲。
    Please accept our warm congratulations to you on becoming a young father.
6. 听到您这个好消息我们非常开心。
    We are very pleased to hear of your great news.
7. 我等不及要看您的宝宝了。
    I can hardly wait to see your new baby.

 知道错的原因吗？
1. 将“男婴”这个意思时，我们要用 a baby boy 来表示，而不是 a boy baby。 boy baby 听起来像是中文直接译成汉语的用法， baby boy 才是“男婴” 较口语的表达。

2. delight 可作为动词和名词来使用，而形容词则要变成 delighted。

3. well 在以上邮件中是形容词作表语，表示“健康的”的意思，而形容词必须放在enough 的前面才对。

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Unit 06| 祝贺获奖
Dear Mr.Cook,
    It was with great pleasure to learn that your company has been awarded the silver medal in the World Invention Contest in Paris. It proves that your investment in research and development has been fully rewarded.

    More importantly, it made a great breakthrough in the human's invention history and brought even more convenience to our life and work. Your totally deserver it.
    Best wishes to you and hope you continue on this success.

Your sincerely,
Henrry

亲爱的库克先生：

很高兴知道贵公司在巴黎世界发明大赛中摘得银牌。这证明你们投注于研发的女里已获得回馈。

更重要的是，它代表着人类发明史上的一次重大突破， 同时也给我们的生活和工作带来了更大的方便。这是你们应得的荣誉。

祝福你们，并希望你们继续朝此方向努力。

您真诚的，
亨利

用这些句型写E-mail就没错！
1. It was with great pleasure to ... 很高兴……
    EX：It was with great pleasure to know that you had won such big prize.
    很高兴知道你获得了如此大奖。
2. It proves that ... 这证明……
    EX：It proves that your efforts are not in vain.
    这证明你的努力没有白费。

如果这样写也可以！
1. 恭喜你获得大奖！
    Congratulations on winning the big prize!
2.据说你是唯一一个得奖的人。
    It is said that you are the only one to get the award.
3. 她获得奥斯卡最佳女演员奖。
    She won the Oscar Award for the best actress.
4. 我很高兴听说你获得了奖学金。
    I am very happy to hear that you have been awarded a scholarship.
5. 很高兴知道你昨天得了奖。
    I am so delighted to know that you received an award yesterday.
6. 我几乎嫉妒你的好运气了。
    I'm almost jealous of your good forture.
7. 这份荣耀完全是你应得的。
    You totally deserve this honor.

知道错的原因吗？
1. 邮件中，couldn't be more happy 这个用法表达的是一种强调的意味，意思是“非常高兴”。
2. 句子的意思是“某人更有资格获得某奖”，因此，我们分析句子可知，这里需要的并不是被动语态，而是需要用形容词deserving来表达“应得的、值得的”这样一个意思才对。
3. “出国留学”的正确表达是：to study abroad。 在这里，abroad 的意思是“到国外、到外面”， 而aboard的意思则是在船（或飞机、车）上。两者要注意区别。
4. come true 是一个固定搭配，表达的是“实现、达到”的意思， 邮件中是要表示梦想已经成真，所以要用现在完成式 has finally come true 才对。

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Unit 07| 祝贺升迁

Dear Steven,
    Congratulations  on your new position in our company. Myself and all the others who know you in this office are not surprised to learn the news because you alway showed your dedication when you were sent to work with our team. People say, "Hard work pays off."

    We are sure that this is just the beginning in a long series of steps up the professional ladder and you will make greater success in the near future.

    Good luck to you!

Yours sincerely,
Wilson

亲爱的史蒂芬

恭喜你在公司的新职务。我和公司其他认识你的人对这个消息都不觉得意外。当你被指派与我们团队合作时你是那么的尽职。俗话说的好：“努力终会获得回报。”

我们相信你会在完后的职业生涯里更上一层楼， 并且在不久的将来获得更大的成功。

祝你好运！

您真诚的，
威尔逊

用这些句型写E-mail就没错！
1. ... when ... 当……
    EX: You worked very hard when you were in the new brance.
    你在新成立的分公司工作十分努力。
2. We are sure that ... 我们相信……
    EX: We are sure that you will achiveve great success as a manager.
   相信你当上经理以后会成就非凡。

如果这样写也可以!
1. 祝贺你升职！
    Congratulations on your promotion!
2.得知你升职了，我非常高兴！
    I was so happy to learn of your promotion.
3. 这真的是你应该得到的。
    I must say you really deserve it.
4. 请接受我们最衷心的祝福，希望你在新的岗位上获得成功。
    Please accept our best wishes for every success in your new position.
5. 相信你会在新的岗位上获得很大的成功。
    I am sure that you will make great success in your new position.
6. 过去这些年你工作得太辛苦了， 这是你应得的。
    You have worked so hard these years and you deserve it.
7. 请接受我最热烈的祝贺。
    Please accept my warmest congratulations.

知道错的原因吗？
1. promotion of sth. 表示“（对某事业的）促进、提倡、赞助”的意思，而要表达升职到某一职位，则后面要接续不定词to，而不是of。
2. 表示“最……之一”，用one of + 最高级+名词复数。 注意：of 后面应该接续最高级。因此， 这里要用the ablest men 而不是 the able men。
3. as 作代词时， 有时会与such、the smae 、 as 等连用， 引导子句，表示“与……相同的事物（或人）”。
4. 在邮件中是要表达过去再香港所做过的事，所以应该使用过去式did，而非do。
5. in 后面一般接的是大地点，如：London（伦敦），而at 后面接的一般为小地点，如：school（学校）。

Unit 08| 祝贺病人身体康复
Dear MIchelle,
    I am so glad to hear that you have recovered from your illness. I was worried sick when your husband told me that you were seriously ill, so were Bob and Susan.
    Now you have got through the bad winter in your life, I believe you can overcome any difficulty, whatever it may be.
    We are dying to see you, our  dearest friend. And we all hope you can live a happy life with your family from now on.
    Best wishes to you!
Yours sincerely,
Peter

亲爱的米歇尔：
很高兴听到你身体康复的消息。当你的丈夫告诉我你病重的时候，鲍勃、苏珊和我都十分担心你的身体状况。

现在你已经度过了你生命的寒冬，我相信你今后可以克服任何困难。

真的很想见到你，我们最最亲爱的朋友。 也希望你和你的家人能从此过着幸福的生活。

祝福你！

您真诚的，
彼得

用这些句型写E-mail就没错！
1.... and ...  ……，而且……
EX: I believe that you can recover and come back soon.
    我相信你能很快恢复健康并回到家中来。
2whatever ... 不管什么……
EX: You should learn to be brave , whatever the difficulties may be.
   不管有什么困难，你都要学会勇敢面对。

如果这样写也可以！
1. 请接受我真诚的问候。
Please accept my sincere regards.
2.恭喜你这么快就痊愈了。
Contratulations on your speedy recoverty.
3.我希望您的病根已经全部消除了。
I hope that it is all over by now.
4. 我想办个派对来庆祝你的归来。
I am thingking of holding a celebration to welcome you back.
5. 非常高兴知道您正在恢复中。
I am so pleased to know that you are on the way to recovery.
6. 很高兴得知您快速复原了。
I am so glad to hear of your fast recovery.
7. 我听说你昨天下午已经出院了。
I heard that you have left hospital yesterday afternoon.

知道错的原因吗？
1. worth 可做形容词和名词两种词性。作形容词时， 有 be worth sth. 这个用法，表示的是“值得……”的意思。
2. since 在邮件中的句子中表示的是“既然、因为、由于”的意思， 无需再加so，所以 I will 才正确。
3. sometime 表示的是“在（将来或过去）某一时候”，而some time则表示“一段时间”这个意思， 因此，后者才是符合句子意思的。
4. 恢复健康应使用return to healthiness , 而非 health。

Unit 01|感谢邀请
Dear Mr. Robert,
    My wife joins me in thanking you for a very delightful night at your house last Saturday.

    The delicious  food , pleasant people and intelligent conversation made the occasion an unforgettable one for both of us.

    Once again, to express our thankfulness to you for your zealous invitation and warm frindship, I wish you and your family happiness forever.
    Your sincerely ,

亲爱的罗伯特先生：

我和我的夫人为您上周六的邀请表示感谢，我们在您家度过了一个非常愉快的夜晚。

晚宴上精美的食物、令人愉快的客人以及充满智慧的交谈都让我们留下了难忘的回忆。

再次感谢您的热情款待和温暖友谊，并祝福您和您的家人永远幸福！

您真诚的，

1. 感谢您邀请我们参加您的派对。
    Thank you for invitation us to your party.
2. 感谢您邀请我参加这个节目。
    Thanks for having me on your show.
3. 请代我向您所有的家人表示感谢。
    Please send my thanks to all your family members.
4. 感谢您的邀请并期待下一次的交流。
    I thank you for your invitation and look forward to our next meeting.
5. 期望您在不久之后有机会来我们家做客。
    I expect that you will have a chance to visit our home soon.
6. 食物很美味，客人也很友善。
    The food was dilicious and the people were friendly.
7. 非常感谢您的盛情款待。
    Thank you so much for your warm hospitality.
8. 与您一起进餐是我的荣幸。
    It was indeed a pleasure to have dinner with you.

知道错的原因吗？
1. 在这里应该用was 而不是is。 从内容得知此次邀请是昨晚的事， 那么评论这个鸡尾酒会如何也是过去的状态。 所以此处be动词应该用过去式was。

2 短语 make acquaintance with， 意为 “与……结识”。 此为固定短语， 注意介词应为 with 而不是 of。 因为是过去式，而且结识很多人所以用 made acquaintances with。

3 此处应用分词形式 thanking 而不是动词原形 thank。 原因是动词 thank 前面有介词 in。 而介词后面的动词一般应为分词形式。

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Unit 02|感谢款待

Dear Simon,
    Thank you so much for the nice dinner on Sunday night. You are such an excellent chef! I am so lucky to be able to enjoy your wonderful food.

亲爱的西蒙：

非常感谢你周日晚上丰盛的晚餐。 你真是个很棒的厨师！ 能品尝到如此美味的食物我感到非常幸运。

作为你的好朋友我也感到很高兴很骄傲。 我真的非常喜欢美味的晚餐和你的热情款待。

7. 感谢您向我们介绍了众多的名胜古迹。
I appreciate you introducing us so many places of interest.
8. 感谢您向我们进行了如此详细的产品解说。
Thank you for giving us such a detailed presentation of your products.

知道错的愿意吗？
1. I would like to 后面应该要接动词原形 express 而不是分词形式 expressing。
2. take...out of ... 意思是“把……从……取出、拿出”。这里的介词应该用of 而不是from。 字面理解 taking time out of your busy schedule 的意思就是“把时间从繁忙的时间表拿出来”也就是中文常说的“从百忙之中抽空出来”。这是一种非常礼貌客气的说法，因而非常适合用于感谢信之中。
3. in the near future 意思是“在不久的将来”。要注意的是这里的介词应该是in 而不是 on。

    We were pleased to be able to shwo you our facilities.
8. 我们期待您下一次的参访。
    We are looking forward to your visit next time.

知道错的原因吗？ 解析，分析改成正确写法的原因
1. 固定搭配 arrange for 意思是 “为……做准备、为……做安排”， 后面应该接介词 for 而不是 to。
2. 这里应该用动词的过去式 had， 而不是动词原形 have。 the day before 表示“前天”的意思，是个很明显的过去时间，所以动词应该用过去式。
3. 固定搭配 help sb. do sth. ， 所以在此 help 后面应该接动词原形 visit 而无需加不定词 to。 后面直接接动词原形的还有： make sb. do sth. /let sb. do sth. 等
4. 固定搭配 send one's gratitude, 意思为“表示某人的感谢”。

Unit 04|感谢建议
Dear Mr. Brown,
    I would like to express thankfulness for giving my son the benifit of your helpful advice about his future career.

    He learnt many things from your talk. Thanks to you , he has got an insight into the problem. He said that he could not think of a better example for him to follow than yours.

    I appriciate your kind assistance and suggestions on behalf of my son.

Yours sincerely,

7.  关于这件事，你能给我一些建议吗？
  Can you give me any suggestions on this matter?
8.  您的建议真的使我受益良多。
  Your advice really helps me greatly.

知道错的原因吗？
1. practice 为名词，意为“联系、实践”。 它的形容词是practical 意为“实际的，使用的”。 “表达切实可行的”	，可以说practical and feasible . 可以单独用practical表达此意。
2. for a long time 意为“好长一段时间”,开头的介词应该用for 而不是with
3. 这里要注意so 和 such的区别。都表示“这样、如何”的意思。用法有区别。So 后面跟形容词或副词再加冠词、名词。  such后面跟冠词、形容词、名词。 例如： so beautiful a girl = such a beautiful girl。此处应该用such a beautiful and intelligent woman

8. 请接受这份礼物以表达我们对您的感激之情。
	Please accept this gift in appreciation of all you've done for us.

知道错的原因吗？
1. gratitude 为名词，意思是“感激、感谢、感恩之心”。 attitude 意为“态度 、看法、姿势”。 express “表达”的应该是“感谢、感激”而不是“态度”， 故在邮件中应写express my gratitude。此处属于相似字之间的混淆。

2 表达“填写”， 可以说fill out /fill in , 但是不能说fill on ， 因为无此搭配。

3 短语 make it 意为 “成功、达到预定目标”。 而 make them 并无此意。 表达成功还可以说：make one's own way/ succeed / meet with success等。

知道错的原因吗？解析，分析改成正确写法的原因
1 表达“由于、因为”，可以说because /for。如果后面接的是名词或名词短语，那么要用because of 或者 for。当表达因……而感谢……的时候，则一般用thank sb. for sth.， 所以这里的介词应为for。
2 短语 get back on track 意为 “回到轨道上、恢复正常、言归正传”。其中的介词应该为on 而不是from。 并无 get back from track 这个短语。
3 短语 get back on one’s feet 意为“从失败中重新站起来、从新开始”。这里feet 用的是复数形式，不能用单数形式。
4 believe 和 believe in 都有“相信”的意思，但含义稍有不同。请通过下列例句来区分其中的差别。
（1）	I believe you. 我相信你。（believe 在此为及物动词）
（2）	I believe in you. 我信任你。（believe 在此为不及物动词）邮件中应为（2）用法。

知道错的原因吗？
1. 在此处正确的搭配应该是due to 或者 because of。 表达 “因为、由于”的短语还有： on account of/by reason of / owing to等。
2. 短语in other words 意为“换句话说、也就是说”。 中间应为other 而不是another。 请注意他们之间细微的差别。
3.短语make up one's mind 意为“下定决心”。 determine/decide和make decision也表示“决定/下决心”。但是固定短语表达“下定决心”只能是make up one‘s mind 而不是make up one’s decision。 这显然是一种错误的搭配。

知道错的原因吗？
1. 表达“有” 可以说： have 或者 there be 。 但绝对不能混合着说 there will have， 邮件内文应为 there will be。 这是个比较容易出错的英语知识点。要牢记哦！
2. 这里要注意too much 和 too many的区别： too much 后面接的是不可数名词。如 too much water “太多的水”；而 too many 后面接的是可数名词复数， 如 to many trees “太多的树”。
3. 短语 meet the requirements 意为“满足要求” 的意思。 这里要注意的是在不定词to后面要用动词原形而不是分词形式。 表达“满足要求、达到要求”还可以说：satisfy/accomodate the demand of 或 reach the requirements等。

****知道错的原因吗？ 解析，分析改成正确写法的原因
1. promote 是指 “升职、晋升”的意思， 若要表达“某人升职至某一职位”  则通常会说be promoted to + 职位， 所以邮件内文应为promoted to。

2 表达 “超过、多于”可以说： more than / in excess of等。 或者单词 over 也可以表示“超过”。 但要注意的是并没有more over + 数字的用法， 只是more than 或者单独的over + 数字即可。

3 短语feel free to 意为 “可以随便、尽情、随意”。 free 意为“自由的、大方的、免费的”， 在此取“自由的”的意思， 为形容词， 不能用它的副词形式。

4 短语contact with 意为“与……联系、与……接触”。 用法为sb.contact （-s /-ed）with sb.。 其中的介词应为with 而不是to。

知道错的原因吗？
1  by chance 这个搭配才有“偶然地、意外地”的意思，而 by incident这个说法则是不存在的。

2 在这里，be interested in sth. 才是正确的搭配， 表达的意思是”对……感兴趣“。

Dear Mr. Brown,

    I can not believe that my delivery just arrived a week after I placed the order.

    The delevery man told me that my delievey was delayed because the previous address was wrong and he needed to check it out. But I did remember that I told them the right address and they also told me that the goods would reach me within three days. I do hope you can take care of this and promise that such thing will not happpen again.

Yours sincerely,

知道错的原因吗？ 解析，分析改成正确写法的原因
1 highly 是表示“高度地”的意思，通常指的是地位、等级或评价等，deeply是表示“深深地、强烈地”的意思，所以如果要表达“深深的歉意”时， 不会说highly sorry, 而会说deeply sorry。

2 point本身的意思是“指”， 而只有用point out 才有“指出”的意思。 因此， 在point 后面要加out次对。

3 by 后面动词要用其动名词形式，表示的“通过某种方式”的意思。因此， 这里要用issuing才对。

4 expres/quick两种都有“快递”的意思， 但“快递”这个意思应该用express delivery 来表达， 而quick delivery 的意思则是“交货迅速”， 并不是邮件中那个快递的意思。

1. 根据句意及逻辑关系可知，这句话是that 引导的同位语从句， 而不是定语从句。而同位语从句不能用which来引导。
2. 短语 either of 意为“任何一个、两者选一”。 短语 neither of 意为“两个中没有一个”。 这两个是具有相反意思的短语， 究竟用哪个就必须结合上下文的意思。 短语后还有一个not， 但是在此并没有表达双重否定的意思。 所以要用neither of 这个短语。
3. 短语 be liable for 意为“对……应负责任”。 这是固定的短语， 其中的介词应该用 for 而不能用 on， 表达“对……负有责任”的短语还有： be responsible for/ answer for。

2. 表达“一点”可以说： a bit / a little。 a few 意思是“有些、几个” 后面接可数名词复数。 例如， a few apples “几个苹果”。  a few 不能表达程度的大小。
3.actualy为“事实上”的意思。 邮件中欲表达“但事实上”， 虽然中文有“但”的出现， 不过actually本身已带有转折语气， 则英语用法无需在加but， 所以but actually是错误的。
4. finished product 意为“成品、产品”。 其中的finished是过去分词， 表达“完成的、结束的”之意。 而finishing现在分词，表达“最后的、终点的”之意。 finished procut是表达“成品”的固定用法。

Unit 03|拒绝更改交易条件

Dear Mr. Redfield,

    We are terribly sorry to inform you that wse have to decline your request to alter our terms of exchange.

    If you find our terms are not in accordance with your requirements, we might suggest you try seeking other suppliers.

    We wish to have another opportunity to cooperate with you next time.

Yours sincerely,
BT Co.

尊敬的雷德菲尔德先生：

非常抱歉地告知您， 我们不得不拒绝您想要更改交换条件的要求。

如果您觉得我们的条款和您要求的不一致，我们建议您不妨试着再找找其他供应商。

希望下次我们还有机会合作。

您诚挚的，
BT 公司

用这些句型写E-mail就没错

We are terribly sorry to inform you that ... 非常抱歉告知您……
    EX: We are terribly sorry to inform you that your requirement is beyone the scope of our service.
          非常抱歉告诉您贵方所提要求不在我方的服务范围内。

如果这样写也可以！
1. 很抱歉， 我们无法变更我们的交易条件。
    We are sorry that we can't change our trade terms.
2. 请告知我方，您是否愿意再考虑一下这些交易条件。
    Please inform us if you can reconsider these terms.
3. 您说您需要与我们再协商一下产品、价格、交易条件等条款。
    You said that you want to negotiate with us on prices, delivery schedule, and purchase terms.
4. 您说您应该获得更好的交易条件。
    You told us you need to get the best possible deal.
5. 报价单中， 我方已报出最好的交易条件。
    We have quoted our best terms in the attached price lists.
6. 我已经尽力为你域供应商浅谈贸易条件。
    I've  done my best to negotiate the trade terms with the supplier for you .
7. 我们的产品在这个地方很受欢迎。
    Our products are very popular in the area.
8. 我们不能放宽基本的交易条件。
    We cannot relax the basic terms of the transation.

这封信在讲什么？

敬启者：

很遗憾得知您对我方的交易条件不太满意。 然而，我方不能接受您对交易条件的更改。

我们仍然相信这是我方能够提供的最好的条件。 大多数的供应商都已广泛采纳我方的交易条件。

如果您再次考虑后决定接受我们的交易条件， 请与我们联系。

您真诚的，
NKC公司

知道错的原因吗？
1. be satisfied with 意为“对……感到满意”。 是固定的短语。 在这里be 动词后面要用satify的过去分词satified， 而不是现在分词satifying。

2.accept 和receive 都有“接受”的意思， 两者的区别是：accept是主观上主动接受， 而receive是客观上被动接受。在此应用accept。

3. wish to do sth. 意为“希望做某事”。 其中要有不定式to。 wish后面不能直接加动词原形。 类似的用法还有：hope to do sth.。

4. consideration 是“考虑”的意思， 而reconsideration 是“再考虑”的意思， 邮件中有“请对方再次考虑”的含义， 所以应为after reconsideration。

都记熟了吗？

Dear Mr. Redfield.

    We are terribly sorry to inform you that we have to ______ your request to ______ our terms of ______.
    If you find our ________ are not in _______ with your _________, we might suggest you _________ seeking other _______.

Unit 04|拒绝延缓交货日期
Dear Mr.Blake,
    I am sorry that we cannot accept your request for delay in delivery.

    Our project is in great need of these building materials, otherwise we cannot complete the task. If it is impossible for you to deliver them on time, we shall have to cancel the order.

    We are sorry to cause you any inconvenience. Thank you for your understanding.

Yours sincerely,
CON Build Company

亲爱的布莱克先生：

很抱歉，我们无法接受您要求交货延迟的请求。

我们的工程急需这批建筑材料， 否则我们无法完工。 如果您无法按时交货， 我们只好取消订单。

非常抱歉给你带来的不便！ 感谢您的理解。

您诚挚的，
CON 建筑公司

用这些句型写E-mail就没错！
1. I am sorry that ... 很抱歉 ……
    Ex: I am sorry that I cannot help you more than that.
    很抱歉我不能帮你更多。
2. If it is impossible for you to ...如果您无法……
    Ex: If it is impossible for you to finish the project on time, we will break up the partership.
  如果您无法准时完成此工程， 我们将会终止合作关系。

如果这样写也可以！
1. 我们不能接受您交货延迟的要求。
    We cannot accept your requirement to postponing the delivery.
2. 延迟将会给我们造成很大的不便。
    The delay will cause great inconvenience to us.
3. 我们仍希望贵公司能在规定时间内交货。
    We still hope you  can deliver the goods at the set time.
4. 我们被告知您无法按时交货。
    We were informed that you could not deliver the goods on time.
5. 对不起，我们不能再等了。
    We are so sorry we cannot wait any longer.
6.希望你们可以了解目前的情况。
    We hope you can understand the current situation.
7. 如果您还是坚持的话，我们将不得不取消订单。
    If you still insist on that , we will have to cancel the order.
8. 我们将要被迫取消这次订单。
    We will be forced to cancel this order.

知道错的原因吗？
1. learn 在这里是“得知，获悉”的意思， 相当于Know。 虽然study 和learn都有“学习”的意思， 但是study并没有”得知、获悉“的意思。不能代替learn。
2. 短语 in that case 意为“既然那样、如果那样的话”， 是固定的短语，其中的介词用in 而不能用on。 类似的表达还有： in this case “既然这样、假如这样的话”。
3. number 是表示“数字”的意思， 但在邮件内文要表示的“小数目”指的是赔偿的总额， 而描述金钱的总额是应该用sum才对。
4. 短语try one‘s best意为“尽最大努力、竭尽全力、尽某人最大的努力”。 其中 best 是形容词good的最高级形式，在这个短语中不能用good 的比较级形式better。

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Unit 05|拒绝取消订单
Dear Mr. Kennedey,
    We are writing to inform you that wae have received your email of December 15th requesting to cancel the order of No. SK143728.

亲爱的肯尼迪先生：

谨以此信通知贵方我方已经收到您在12月15日的来信，信中要求取消号码为SK 143728的订单。

然而， 我们无法接受该项订单取消， 因为已经出货了。

我们诚挚地希望您能谅解。非常感谢！

谨致问候

2. However, we are unable to ... 然而，我们不能……
    EX:However, wer are unable to agree to your new proposal at this statage.

    We were under contract to deliver the goods last week.
8. 收到您的邮件后， 我们就立即执行订单了。
    After receiving  your email, we executed the orders promplty.

知道错的原因吗？
1. feel sorry for sth.  “ 对……刚到抱歉、对……感到遗憾”。 其中的介词应用 for 而不是 to。 类似意思的表达方法还有： be sorry for /feel regret for 等。
2. make sb, do sth.　意为“使某人做某事”。make 后面接动词原形而非动词不定式。 类似用法的表达方法还有：let sb. do sth. / have sb. do sth.
“让某人做某事”。
3. decision 是“决定”的意思， 为可数名词， 所以邮件内文应为such  a decision。
4. something 和 anything最大区别是： 前者用于陈述句， 而后者用于否定句和疑问句。因此在这个一般疑问句中应该用anything 而不是something。

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Unit 06|拒绝提早交货

Dear Mr. Smith,
    Thank you for your e-mail requesting the early delivery of your goods.
    I am sorry to tell you that we cannot advance the date of delivery any more. Through it sounds harsh, as you know , it usually takes us two weeks to get the goods ready. It's really impossible to deliver the goods in such short notice.
    Thank you very much for your understanding.
Yours sincerely,
Bob Hill

亲爱的史密斯先生：

谢谢您的来信要求提前出货。

虽然听起来有点不近人情， 但我还是要告诉您我们无法再将交货日期提前。您是知道的， 我们备货通常需要两个星期。我们真的没办法在如此端的时间内交货。

感谢您的体谅！

您诚挚的，
鲍伯•希尔

用这些句型写E-maio就没错！
1. cannot ... any more ...不能再……
    EX: We cannot advance the time of shipment any more.
    出货的时间真的无法再提前了。
2. sound ... 听起来……
    EX: Your plan sounds goods, but I need to think it over.
    你的计划听起来不错， 但是我需要考虑一下。

如果这样写也可以！
1.  交货日期不能再提前了。
    We cannot advance the delivery date any earlier.
2. 我已经查看了我们的生产进度。
    I have checked our production schedule.
3. 我们现在没办法出货给您。
    We see no way of moving up your delivery now.
4. 非常抱歉，我们不能提前交货。
    I am very sorry that we cannot advance the time of delivery.
5. 我们无法加速生产，提前交货。
    We cannot step up production to advance the time of delivery.
6. 我们已经尽最大的努力交货了。
    We have done our best to deliver the goods.
7. 我们无法将交货日期提前。
    We cannot advance the date of delivery.
8. 我们无法接受您的要求， 提前交货。
    We cannot accept your request for making an earlier shipment.

知道错的原因吗
1. 一般有 thank you for sth. / doing sth. 的用法， 而没有接句子的用法。 因此，在这里， 我们要把requested 改为requesting 才对。
2. 虽然检查发货进度这一动作发生在过去，但是由于这一动作对现在产生了影响，即确定了没法提前供货这件事情，因此，在这里，我们用have check 的现在完成时会更合适些。
3. all 要放在冠词、指示代名词、物主代名词等之前，而whole 应放在这些词之后。 而且，all 一般用于不可数或可数名词， 而whole 则一般用于单数名词。 因此，在这里要用whole 才对。

Unit 07|拒绝提供协助

Dear Mr. Brown,

    I am sorry that I cannot accompany you to London for the exhibition this time because I  am on a business trip now. I am afaid that the exhibition will have concluded by the time I come back.
    I strongly suggest  you ask  John Smith if he is available this week for he is not away on business.

    I sincerely hope that you'll have a wonderful time!

Yours sincerely,
James Lawson

亲爱的布朗先生：

很抱歉这次我不能陪同您一起去伦敦参加展览， 因为我正在出差。 等我回来的时候， 展览恐怕都已经结束了。

强烈建议您询问约翰•史密斯是否能陪您出席，他这周没有去出差。

真诚地希望您旅途愉快！

您诚挚的，
詹姆斯•劳森

用这些句型写E-mail就没错！
1. by the time ... 到……的时候
   EX: By the time I come back , you will have gome to Japan.
    等我回来的时候，你已经去日本了。
2. suggest(that)... 建议……
   EX: I suggest that you go to New York with your uncle.
    我建议你跟你叔叔一起去纽约。

如果这样写也可以！
1. 我们无法帮您找到信息。
    We are unable to help you find the information.
2. 对不起，我们不能给贵公司提供技术协助。
    I am so sorry that we cannot supply technical assistance to your caompany.
3. 恐怕那方面我无法帮助您。
    I am afraid that I cannot help you there.
4. 建议您向其他部门寻求帮助。
    I suggest you ask for help from other departments.
5. 很抱歉这事我无法帮您。
    I am sorry to say that I cannot be of any assistance to you about that.
6. 很抱歉， 我无法帮助您。
    I am very sorrry that I cannot help you  with that.
7. 因为某些理由，我们无法提供协助给您。
    We cannot give you assistance for certain reason.
8. 很遗憾，我不能帮您。
    I am very much regret that I cannot help you with this.

知道错的原因吗？
1. 判断如何使用a 或an的方法就是看后面接的单词首字母是什么， 若是a/e/i/o/u 这五个元音字母的话则接an， 若是其他子音则接a。

2. suggest 后面接续that 字句， 表示建议，后面要用should + 动词原形的形式，其中，should 可省略。 因此， 这里我们要用help而不是用helps。

3. 参见会议带的一般都是口译人员，因此在这里要用 interpreter（口译员），而不是translator（多指笔译人员）。

4. make things better 的意思是“使事情更好”，在邮件中，建议带上口译人员是对与会者的一种帮助， 因此， 用比较级在这里会相对更好一点， 也更说得通。

Unit 08|拒绝退款

Dear Mr.Cruise,
    I am so sorry to hear that a quarter of the goods were damaged in the harbor of your country.

    We have told you that you must pack the goods in wooden cases in case they should be damaged during the transportation. However , we cannot refund you the money for the losses because it is clear that it has nothing to do with us.

    Thank you for your understanding.

Yours sincerely,
Julia Laura

亲爱的克鲁斯先生：

很抱歉听说您有四分之一的货物在您那里的港口被破坏。

我们已经告诉过您要用木箱把这些货物装起来以防它们在运输间发生毁损。然而，我们无法为您的损失退款，因为此事显然与我们没有关系。

感谢您的体谅！

您诚挚的，
茱莉亚•萝拉

用这些句型写E-mail就没错！
1. in case ... 以防……
    EX: Please pack the goods into boxes in case they are damaged.
    请把货物装箱以防损坏。
2. It is clear that ... 显然……
    EX: It is clear that the forwarding company should be responsible for this.
    显然货运公司应该对此负责。

如果这样写也可以！
1. 我们无法给您退款。
    We are unable to refund your money this time.
2. 对不起，我们对此爱莫能助。
    I am so sorry that we cannot help you with that.
3. 我们不会对因天气引起的损失负责。
    We will not be responsible for the losses caoused by the weather.
4. 建议您向其他相关部门请求赔偿。
    I suggest you turn to other related departments for compensation.
5. 很抱歉，我对此无能为力。
    I am very sorry that we can do nothing about this.
6. 很遗憾您有部分货物被损坏了。
    I very much regret that part of your goods was damaged.
7. 很抱歉这事我无法帮您。
    I am sorry to say that I cannot be of any assistance to you about that.
8. 由于此事与我们无关，因此我们无法给您退款。
    We cannot refund you the money for it has nothing to do with us.

知道错的原因吗？
1. 在邮件内文中， which 引导的是一个非限定性定语从句， 说明的是claims 的内容。 此时， which前面需要加上介词 in，因此，我们在这里要用 in which 才对。

2. sympathize是不及物动词， 后面要加with 之后才能再接其他成分。

3. turn to的意思是“求助于……、转向……”， 而go to 则表示“去某处”这样一个动作。 又因为在邮件中的句子只是一个建议，要对方向保险公司索赔，所以，在这里我们用turn to 会更合适些。
